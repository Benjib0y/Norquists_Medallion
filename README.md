# Norquists_Medallion
A MyWorld game:

Early in 2018 I hosted a competition in Myworld.
The intention was to promote the game by demonstrating the power of that most excellent toolkit. Sadly I only had one entrant - perhaps because my prize was too miserly or because people were already engaged in their own projects.

The premise was simple - given a title and a collectible as the objective of a quest, how good a game could people make.

Whilst the competition was running I devised my own plot line for Norquist's Medallion.

Now I'm seeking collaborator's to turn my plot into a game.
Download the outline and contact me - ben.houghton@benjiplus.plus.com if you want to have a go at realising the adventure.
