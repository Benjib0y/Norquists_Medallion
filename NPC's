Creators can make the npc's that live in just one world to suit themselves. Where a character is going to appear in more than one world, (or iterations of a world) we obviously need to be able to share them. I am able to extract creature creations from a world and/or merge CC databases.

The npc's which I know will appear in more than one world are:-
The King's advisor Marfelin.
The King ill and healthy.
The gateguards in Kington.
Green Meg - the wisewoman in Shirecross.
Will Ironarm - the blacksmith in Shirecross.
Herbert Crusty - the village elder in Shirecross.
